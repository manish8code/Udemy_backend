const EventEmitter =require("events");
the EventEmitter class sort of thing is created

const eventEmitter =new EventEmitter();
now the object kind of thing is created

now we can apply many different things to this 
like   eventEmitter.on   .once and so on....

eventEmitter.on("",funciton)  the first one is the event and second is funciton
