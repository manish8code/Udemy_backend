utf-8 is character encoding

what are buffer in node.js?

*A buffer is a temporary storage area for binary data.

*Node.js does not support direct binary maniopulateion(like c/c++)
so buffers help handle raw data efficiently.

*use mostly when dealing with file streams, network data, and binary protocols.


Why do we need buffers?

*js string are utf-16 encoded,
making direct binary data handling inefficient.

*Buffers store binary data outside V8's heap.

*useful when working with:
  file system(fs module)
  networking(tcp,udp,websocket)
  streams(handling chunks of data)
